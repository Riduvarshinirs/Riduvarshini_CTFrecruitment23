- the description for this challenge says that the image is corrupted
- i read the reading material then i used ghex command i opened the corrupted image in ghex
- i used pngcheck to see if the png file has any error
- when i opened the png file in ghex i noticed that the magic numbers were wrong and also the critical chunks were wrong
- so i changed the magic numbers and all the critical chunks to the correct one
- and now when i tried opening the image i found the flag
- flag- bi0s{1_ju5t_needed_s0m3_f1x1ng_up_91253}
