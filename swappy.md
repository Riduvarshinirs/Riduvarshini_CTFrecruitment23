# sw4ppy
- when i opened the attachment chall.png it was corrupted then i read the given reading material
- i read about magic number and critical chunks
- i used ghex command and opend the file
- in magic numbers and the critical chunks i noticed that each number was swapped to the next one so i realised the whole file must be swapped as rhe challenge name says
- so i opened the file as bytes using python file handeling
- i wrote a code for swapping each no. and wrote it in another file
- when i opened the output file i found a image and i got the flag
- flag- bi0s{as_3asy_as_th4t_2143}
