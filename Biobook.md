- in description it gives us clue to check the site
- when i opened the deployment i went to site where i found /Bio?id=1 in the url
- where id is the parameter name and 1 is the parameter value
- i tried to change the parameter value
- i changed the value of parameter from 1-6 and i found different different bios,and after 6 it gave me user not found error
- so i tried giving 0 and i found reading material on IDOR
- and i found flag in that
- flag- flag{yZReKAqhnKKF7Bf7Z1iYGg==}
